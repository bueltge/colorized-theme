# Colorized Theme
My personal colorized theme.

### Background
I like to work with nice UIs, but on the focus to work, create a result. This Theme is a mix from a lot of colours. To work day and night on the ideas.

_Currently I have only the dark theme for the PhpStorm IDE._

 * Colorized Dark for PhpStorm IDE

### Other Notes
Oh also, I'm German. My English might be gruesome here and there. I  making spelling mistakes, like COLOR or COLOUR. With or without the U - the result is important for me. ;)
