# Colorized Theme

My personal colorized theme.

### Background

I like to work with nice UIs, but with the focus to work and create a result. This theme mixes several colors to work day and night on the ideas.

Currently, I have only a dark theme for the PhpStorm IDE.

* Colorized Dark for PhpStorm IDE

### Font

With the change in January 2020, version 3.1.0, I used Font Mono as the default main font and Monospaced as a fallback font. If you like Mono also, download and install the font from the [Jetbrains page]([https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

Before, I used [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) since Version 2.0.0 is the primary font.

But you should use your favorite font, and the installation of Mono or Roboto Mono is unnecessary.
