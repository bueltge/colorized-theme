# Colorized Theme
My personal colorized theme.

### Background
I like to work with nice UIs, but on the focus to work, create a result. This Theme is a mix from a lot of colours. To work day and night on the ideas.

_Currently I have only the dark theme for the PhpStorm IDE._

* Colorized Dark for PhpStorm IDE

### Font

Colorized uses [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) since Version 2.0.0 as main font and it's highly recommend to install it. But you can use your favorite font and the install of Roboto Mono is not necessary.

### Screenshots

#### Version 3.0.0
